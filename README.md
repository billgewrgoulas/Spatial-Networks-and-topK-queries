# Spatial-Networks-and-topK-queries

Tasks:  
* Spatial network representation using Adjacency lists.  
* Traversing the network and finding closest distances using Dijkstra and Astar algorithms.  
* Performing topK queries by combining NRA and dijkstra 's algorithms. Given a set of starting points the algoritm returns the optimal meeting point in the network. The omp is the one that minimizes the maximum distance of all the distances from start to finish.
